# H7 I2C Tutorial
This project demonstates how to use the I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol to communicate with the DS1307 real time clock module.
As you will see in the code, the RTC's time registers are set to Monday, October 25th 2021, 00:00:00 and 24h mode is used.
Some useful documentation about I2C and the DS1307 can be found in the following links: https://forum.digikey.com/t/using-the-stm32cube-hal-i2c-driver-in-master-mode/15122 and https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS1307.pdf
